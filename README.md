## Abstract

This project explores the application of linear regression for predicting car prices based on various attributes. Using a dataset containing car features and prices, we preprocess the data, analyze attribute correlations, and build a regression model. The achieved R-squared score of 0.836 demonstrates the model's effectiveness in price prediction.

## Introduction

Predicting car prices is crucial for buyers and sellers. This project leverages linear regression to estimate car prices based on attributes like wheelbase, engine size, and horsepower.

## Methods

### Data Preparation

- Data loaded from a UCI Machine Learning Repository dataset.
- Columns with low variance removed.
- Missing values replaced and data types converted.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Pair plots created to visualize attribute relationships.

### Linear Regression Model

- Predictor variables selected.
- Data split into training and testing sets.
- Linear regression model trained and coefficients analyzed.

## Results

- The linear regression model achieved an R-squared score of 0.836 on the test data.

## Discussion

The model's coefficients indicate the impact of each attribute on car prices. A higher R-squared value signifies the model's goodness of fit.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the utility of linear regression in predicting car prices, aiding both buyers and sellers in informed decision-making.
